Problem Statement
Managing library book transactions manually can be inefficient and error-prone, especially when tracking which books are available, issued, overdue, or returned. There is a need for a system that automates these processes to save time, reduce mistakes, and improve overall library management for educational institutions.​

Scope of the Project
This project covers the automation of common library operations such as listing available books, issuing books to students, managing return submissions, and calculating fines for late returns. It uses Python and SQLite to store and manipulate library and student data, providing a simple and efficient solution suitable for small to medium-sized libraries.​
